A set of two Splunk dashboards that provide a way to add Yellow Sticky Pad type notes to a dashboard.  The notes are kept in a local csv file.

The sticky_note dashboard is a sample.  You can use the code from the Sticky Note Panel to copy to a different dashbaord.

The sticky_note_maintain dashboard is used to add new Sticky Notes to present in the panel where ever you place it.

There is a link to edit the existing notes via the Splunk Lookup Editor App.
